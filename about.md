The mission of the Brown Integrated General Artificial Intelligence project is to develop agents with human-level problem-solving ability and communication skills. We believe that these fully integrated, generally intelligent agents should be robots: embodied systems which perceive the world through their sensors, affect the world through their actuators, and interact with humans in complex environments. In order to build these agents, we are drawing on our faculty's expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, and applying cutting-edge ideas to the full AI problem: building machines that learn, reason, and communicate about the natural world. It is our hope that together we can build the world’s first truly generally intelligent robot.

Welcome to bigAI @ Brown. Let’s get started!
