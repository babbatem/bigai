In this paper, we proposed an approach to remove the need for a target network from Deep Q-learning. Our DeepMellow algorithm, the combination of Mellowmax operator and DQN, can learn stably without a target network when tuned with specific temperature parameter Ï‰. We proved novel theoretical properties (convexity, monotonic increase, and overestimation bias reduction) of Mellowmax operator, and empirically showed that Mellowmax operator can obviate the need for a target network in multiple domains.
