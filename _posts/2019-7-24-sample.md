Here's an example of a blog post, written with Markdown and HTML.

I ask that you render with Jekyll while you write in order to ease integration with the existing set of posts. Please clone the website source [from my github](https://github.com/babbatem/bigai), and build & serve locally using `jekyll serve` from the root; see the repo for jekyll setup, it's very straightforward. To view your post, include your post as a .md file in the `_posts` directory named "YYYY-MM-DD-title.md" and it will be included and linked from the Blog page.

Note that markdown inside an HTML tag will not be expanded, and you'll have to adjust syntax inside HTML blocks. For example:
<justify>
this [link](www.google.com) will not work, this $$math$$ will be on its own line, this \( math\) will be inline, *italics don't work*, etc.
</justify>
whereas [this link](www.google.com) works, this $$math$$ goes inline, and *I'm italicized*.

There's a helpful Markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), but note that some features aren't quite the same as a generic markdown editor. Please render while you write to ensure the post looks as you intend.

To submit your post for upload, I'll need the markdown file as well as any images you include. A merge request might work, or just email me relevant files and I'll make sure they end up in the right place.

Happy blogging :)

# Quick Examples
Math is rendered using MathJax with LaTeX syntax for your convenience, e.g.
$$ R : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \mapsto \mathbb{R} $$

To include images:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![alt text](/assets/images/bigai/bigai_white100.png){:height="70px" width="100px"}
{: refdef}

You can also write HTML directly if you want, but be aware that the markdown you write inside will be left untouched:
<section id="foo" class="spotlights">
		<section>
			<a href="http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/" class="image">
					<img src="/assets/images/stefie-smile-onstage.jpg" alt="" style="position:relative;margin-top:10px;margin-left:10px;width:auto;height:200px;"/>
			</a>
				<div class="content">
					<div class="inner">
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Stefanie Tellex</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="font-size: 20px"> Here's a nice box about Stefanie. </p>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li><a href="http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/" class="button">Learn More</a></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>
</section>

I'm happy to hear any and all feedback about the website's design!
