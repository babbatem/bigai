Here's an example of a blog post, written with Markdown and HTML.

If you want to render while you write, you can clone the website source [from my github](https://github.com/babbatem/bigai), and build & serve locally using `jekyll serve` from the root; see the repo for jekyll setup, it's very straightforward. Include your post as a .md file in the `_posts` directory and it will be included in the Blog page.  

There's a helpful Markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

To submit your post for upload, I'll need the markdown file as well as any images you include. A merge request might work, or just email me relevant files and I'll make sure they end up in the right place.

Happy blogging :)

# Quick Examples
Math is rendered using MathJax with LaTeX syntax for your convenience, e.g.
$$ R : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \mapsto \mathbb{R} $$

To include images:
![alt text](./assets/images/bigai/bigai_white100.png){:height="70px" width="100px"}

You can also write HTML directly if you want:
<section id="foo" class="spotlights">
	<section>
		<a href="http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/" class="image">
			<img src="assets/images/stefie-smile-onstage.jpg" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:auto;height:200px;"/>
		</a>
		<div class="content">
			<div class="inner">
				<header class="major">
					<h3>Stefanie Tellex</h3>
				</header>
				<p> Here's a nice box about Stefanie. </p>
				<ul class="actions">
					<li><a href="http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/" class="button">Learn More</a></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
	</section>
</section>

I'm happy to hear any and all feedback about the website's design!
