While modern RL algorithms have achieved impressive results on hard problems, they have struggled in long-horizon problems with sparse rewards. [Hierarchical reinforcement learning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022140919877) is a promising approach to overcome these challenges.  


While the benefit of using hierarchies has been known for a long time, the question of how useful hierarchies can be discovered autonomously has remained largely unanswered. In this work, we present an algorithm that can construct temporally extended, higher level actions (called **skills**) from the set of primitive actions already available to the RL agent.  


Not only is the ability to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems a [hallmark](https://www.princeton.edu/~yael/Publications/RibasFernandesSolwayEtAl2011.pdf) of intelligence, it is also the missing piece from traditional/flat reinforcement learning techniques. By constructing useful hierarchies, RL agents will be able to combine modular solutions to easy sub-problems to reliably solve hard real-world problems.

We propose Deep Skill Chaining as a step towards realizing the goal of autonomous skill discovery in high-dimensional problems with continuous state and action spaces.
